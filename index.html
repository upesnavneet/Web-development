                    <br>
                    The Library Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage books efficiently within a library. The system allows librarians or users to add, view, issue, and return books while maintaining persistent records for future sessions.
                    <br><br>
                    Key Features:
                    <br>
                    âœ… Add Books: Users can add new books to the system by entering the book's ID, title, and author. <br>
                    âœ… Display Books: Lists all available books along with their ID, title, author, and issue status. <br>
                    âœ… Issue Books: Users can borrow books by entering the book ID, marking them as issued. <br>
                    âœ… Return Books: Books can be returned, updating their status to available. <br>
                    âœ… Data Persistence: The system saves book records using file handling (books.dat), so data is retained between sessions. <br>
                    <br>
